# This is the Privacy Guard repo!

Track of all your data and protect your privacy in one, simple place.


Tech companies collect data about you. Why? Because that's their business model - you get the service, they get your data.


Aren't you curious to know what they are collecting? Actually, they know everything.


Nowadays keeping track of all your data is a nightmare, you need to visit tons of separate, confusing pages. It's practically impossible.


Privacy Guard enables you to keep track of all your data in one, simple place.

It lets you disable location history, personalization features and many more with simple buttons.


Features:

- One place to track all privacy settings.

- Disable what you don’t need with one button.

- Get a “privacy score” that states how private your data is.
